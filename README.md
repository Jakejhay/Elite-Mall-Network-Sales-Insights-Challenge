#Introduction#
In this case study, you are Jordan, a data analyst at Elite Mall Network, a chain of luxury shopping centers across California. The company has collected transaction-level sales data from 2021-2023, including details on invoices, customers, product categories (like Clothing, Shoes, and Technology), quantities sold, prices, and the specific mall location. With holiday seasons approaching and inventory budgets tight, the CEO wants actionable insights from this data to optimize stock levels, launch targeted customer promotions, and boost foot traffic at underperforming malls.
This case study was created by me, with inspiration by the classic Danny's 8 Weeks SQL challenge by Data With Danny, named [Danny's Diner SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). which I adapted for this e-commerce context.
